# Car Inspector

This mod displays detailed information about the Corris Rivette, including parts wear and current car adjustments such as fuel mixture, engine timing, and wheel alignment. It also shows fluid level and battery charge.
The idea was suggested in the comments of my previous mod and is inspired by the Engine Info mod from My Summer Car.

Default keybind is F10

In spoiler mode to show value - toggle window, click ESC, use mouse to click on hidden value to show it. Click again to hide.
